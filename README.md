# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program  

### Making changes in `client3.py` 
1. Modifying the `getDataPoint` function to compute the right stock price,  
so that the variable `price` is computed by using the formula: (bid_price+ask_price) / 2.
2. Modifying the `getRatio` function to change the `return` value to the  
ratio of stock `price_a` to stock `price_b` rather than returning the value `1`.
3. `Main method` : Created a `prices` dictionary to store the stock prices,  
the `key` being the `stock name` and the `value` being the `price`.  
Used the `prices dictionary` at the end to pass in the right values in the `getRatio` function.
